# How to Handle File Uploads in the MERN Blog App

This `upload` directory is intended for local development and demonstration purposes of how file uploads are handled in this MERN stack blog application.

**Current Implementation (Local Storage):**

Currently, this application is configured to store uploaded files directly within the server's local file system in this `upload/` directory. This is typically achieved using a Node.js middleware like `multer`.
